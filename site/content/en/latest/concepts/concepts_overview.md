# Envoy Gateway Resources

There are several resources that play a part in enabling you to meet your Kubernetes ingress traffic handling needs. This page provides a brief overview of the resources youâ€™ll be working with.

# Overview

## Kubernetes Gateway API Resources
- **GatewayClass:** Defines a class of Gateways with common configuration.
- **Gateway:** Specifies how traffic can enter the cluster.
- **Routes:** **HTTPRoute, GRPCRoute, TLSRoute, TCPRoute, UDPRoute:** Define routing rules for different types of traffic.
## Envoy Gateway (EG) API Resources
- **EnvoyProxy:** Represents the deployment and configuration of the Envoy proxy within a Kubernetes cluster, managing its lifecycle and settings.
- **EnvoyGatewayPatchPolicy, ClientTrafficPolicy, SecurityPolicy, BackendTrafficPolicy, EnvoyExtensionPolicy, BackendTLSPolicy:** Additional policies and configurations specific to Envoy Gateway.
